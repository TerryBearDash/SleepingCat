# Sleeping Cat
Cat Facts Made Easy.

[![N|Solid](https://awful-magic.surge.sh/logo192.png)](https://awful-magic.surge.sh/)


When asessing the viability of a searchable indexed dashboard - it is always important to remember who will be using it. In this case it is simple as our users are generally people who have mad love for cats.

# The Task
### You will be building a cat facts dashboard. Please find a rough sketch of the expected apps layout and functionality on the following page of this pdf. A little flare in the design is encouraged. The sketch should only be used as a guide.
- [x] Please return a solution to the task within a week of receiving.
- [x] Please provide full source code and README using any publicly accessible repository.
- [x] Unit tests are expected; however, 100% coverage is not necessary.
- [x] Please include in the README any improvements you would make given more time.

### What you will be building
- [x] You should be able to search by cat text, user first name or user last name.
- [x] Implement pagination.
- [x] A clickable user id that should take you to step 2 in the below sketch.
- [x] Use a random avatar from https://eu.ui-avatars.com/ to display an avatar in step 2 of
the below sketch
- [x] Clicking on the back button should take you back to grid page with cat facts (step 1).

#### Please use the following API’s as data sources for the app:
- [x] https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts
- [x] https://eu.ui-avatars.com/

### Expected technologies
- [x] React
- [x] Redux
- [x] Sass for styles
- [x] No third-party components should be used

### Outcomes
>  Due to the incrdibly basic nature of the task, I added a cat images api to enhance the visual appeal of the site.
> I would also offer that should this project be deployed that the data used for the api needs to be cleaned as there are alot of dirty data in the set.

### Enhancements
  - Add Upvote functionality (Functionality is implemented, just doesn't save successfully as there is no endpoint to update the data)
  - Implement extra filters, (By Type, User and Date Added), to Table grid.
  - Any other enhancements is already present in the site. Please have a look and revert with comments.

# Technology
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
